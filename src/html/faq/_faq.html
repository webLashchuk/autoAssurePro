            What is the difference between comprehensive and collision coverage?
          </summary>

          <p>
            Comprehensive coverage protects your vehicle against damage from events other than collisions, such as
            theft, fire, or natural disasters. Collision coverage, on the other hand, covers damages to your vehicle
            that occur as a result of a collision, regardless of who is at fault.

            What does liability coverage include?

            What should I do if my vehicle needs repairs after an accident?
          </summary>

          <p>
            If your vehicle needs repairs, report the accident to us first. We will assess the damage and direct you to
            one of our approved auto repair shops, or you can choose a shop of your preference. We'll work with the
            repair shop to ensure your vehicle is restored to its condition before the accident, subject to the terms of
            your policy.

            How are my insurance premiums calculated?
          </summary>

          <p>
            Insurance premiums are calculated based on several factors including your driving history, type of vehicle,
            location, and the amount of coverage you choose. The safer your driving record and vehicle, the lower your
            premiums are likely to be.

            Is roadside assistance included in my policy, or do I need to add it separately?
          </summary>

          <p>
            Roadside assistance is available as an additional option with any of our policies. You can add it to your
            coverage to ensure help is available 24/7 in the event of a breakdown, flat tire, or other roadside
            emergencies.
