            What is the difference between comprehensive and collision coverage?
          </summary>

          <p>
            Comprehensive coverage protects your vehicle against damage from events other than collisions, such as
            theft, fire, or natural disasters. Collision coverage, on the other hand, covers damages to your vehicle
            that occur as a result of a collision, regardless of who is at fault.
